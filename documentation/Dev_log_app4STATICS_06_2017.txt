-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE. Errors in solntext that cause EVAL problems can lead to difficulty
	  in debugging. *** esp see if 'ivstr' not defined. ***
	  *** ALWAYS check solntext code carefully for syntax and vbl labeling
			errors. ***
